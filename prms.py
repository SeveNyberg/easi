AU = 1.4959e8 # km, While A is approximately equal to the semi-major axis of the Earth’s orbit, it is not exactly so. Nor is it exactly the mean Earth-Sun distance. There are a number of reasons: a) the Earth’s orbit is not exactly Keplerian due to relativity and to perturbations from other planets; b) the adopted value for the Gaussian gravitational constant k is not exactly equal to the Earth’s mean motion; and c) the mean distance in a Keplerian orbit is not equal to the semi-major axis a: r = a(1 + e^2/2), where e is the eccentricity.
